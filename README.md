### GitHub Wiki

GitHub Wiki is a project developed with React JS and the GitHub REPOSITORIES API to create a web application that allows users to easily and interactively search for GitHub repositories. Users can see detailed information about each repository on another web page.

You can search for repositories using an input bar to type a repository name in the format `username/repositoryname` and see all the information for that repository.
